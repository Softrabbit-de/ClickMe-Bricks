# ClickMe-Bricks

"ClickMe - Bricks" is a reinterpretation of the classical Breakout game.
You can run this game in your Browser, but it was originally created for mobile gaming. The game is available under the Apache 2 license. Some of the graphics/fonts are not designed by me as it is mentioned in the credits view of the game.

To make this game run on a mobile device either visit the play-store page mentioned below or compile it yourself by using cordova ( http://cordova.apache.org/ ). For high performance I suggest to have a look at Crosswalk ( https://crosswalk-project.org/ ).
